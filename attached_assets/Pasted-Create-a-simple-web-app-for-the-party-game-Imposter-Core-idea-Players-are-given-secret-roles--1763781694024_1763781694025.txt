Create a simple web app for the party game “Imposter”.

Core idea

Players are given secret roles.

Some are Imposters, the rest are Crewmates who all share the same secret word.

Imposters may optionally get a different “hint word”.

The app only handles setup and role distribution. The actual talking and voting happens offline.

Setup:

Ask for the number of players (between 3 and 10).

Let me enter the player names.

Let me choose the number of imposters:

Minimum 1 imposter.

Maximum = number of players − 1.

Include a toggle/checkbox:

“Give imposters a hint word” (on/off).

Word selection:

Have a hard-coded word list in the code (array of strings).

Randomly pick one word as the Crew word.

If the “hint word” option is ON:

Randomly pick a different word from the list as the Imposter hint word.

If the “hint word” option is OFF:

Imposters do not see any word, only that they are imposters.

Role assignment:

Randomly assign the chosen number of Imposters among the players.

All other players are Crewmates.

For each player:

Crewmate view: “Crewmate – Your word is: [CrewWord]”.

Imposter view:

If hint word is ON: “Imposter – Your hint word is: [HintWord]”.

If hint word is OFF: “You are the Imposter. You do not have a word.”

Role reveal behaviour (very important):

After setup, show a list of player names on the screen.

When a player taps/clicks on their name:

Show their role and word/hint word for a short time (e.g. 3–5 seconds).

After the delay, hide it again and go back to just showing the list of names.

This is designed so one phone can be passed around and each player checks their role privately.

Game logic (what the app does NOT do):

The app does not handle rounds, timers, or voting.

Its only job is to:

Take the number of players and names.

Let me choose number of imposters and the “hint word” option.

Choose the word(s).

Randomly assign roles.

Let players privately reveal their role by tapping their name.

Implementation details:

Use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript only (no backend).

Keep the UI simple and mobile-friendly.
