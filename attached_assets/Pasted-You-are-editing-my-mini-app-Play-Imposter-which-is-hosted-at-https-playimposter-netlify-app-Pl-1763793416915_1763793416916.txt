You are editing my mini-app “Play Imposter” which is hosted at https://playimposter.netlify.app
.
Please make the following changes exactly as described.

1. Create the Farcaster miniapp manifest

In the project root, create a folder named:

.well-known

(Use that exact name, including the dot at the start.)

Inside that folder, create a file named:

farcaster.json

Put the following EXACT JSON in farcaster.json:

{
  "accountAssociation": {
    "header": "",
    "payload": "",
    "signature": ""
  },
  "baseBuilder": {
    "ownerAddress": "0xYOUR_BASE_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS"
  },
  "miniapp": {
    "version": "1",
    "name": "Play Imposter",
    "homeUrl": "https://playimposter.netlify.app",
    "iconUrl": "https://playimposter.netlify.app/icon.png",
    "splashImageUrl": "https://playimposter.netlify.app/icon.png",
    "splashBackgroundColor": "#020617",
    "webhookUrl": "",
    "subtitle": "Party social deduction game",
    "description": "Play Imposter is a fast party game you can run with any group. Everyone gets a secret word except the imposter, who has to fake it while the others try to expose them.",
    "screenshotUrls": [
      "https://playimposter.netlify.app/icon.png"
    ],
    "primaryCategory": "games",
    "tags": ["social", "party", "game", "imposter", "friends"],
    "heroImageUrl": "https://playimposter.netlify.app/icon.png",
    "tagline": "Figure out who’s faking it.",
    "ogTitle": "Play Imposter",
    "ogDescription": "A quick, high-tension social deduction game you can launch inside Base.",
    "ogImageUrl": "https://playimposter.netlify.app/icon.png",
    "noindex": false
  }
}


Do not change the JSON formatting.
Leave header, payload, and signature as empty strings for now.
Leave 0xYOUR_BASE_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS as-is for now (the human will update that value later once they confirm which address to use).

2. Add the fc:miniapp meta tag to the HTML <head>

Find my main HTML file (most likely index.html in the root or in a public-style folder).

Inside the <head> element of that HTML file, add the following <meta> tag if it does not already exist:

<meta
  name="fc:miniapp"
  content='{
    "version":"next",
    "imageUrl":"https://playimposter.netlify.app/icon.png",
    "button":{
      "title":"Play Now",
      "action":{
        "type":"launch_miniapp",
        "name":"Play Imposter",
        "url":"https://playimposter.netlify.app"
      }
    }
  }'
/>


Important:

Ensure this <meta> is inside <head>, not inside <body>.

If there is already an fc:miniapp meta tag, replace its entire content value with the JSON above (keeping the same structure as shown).

3. Add the miniapp SDK and call sdk.actions.ready()

In the same main HTML file, before the closing </body> tag, insert the following <script> block once:

<script type="module">
  import { sdk } from 'https://esm.sh/@farcaster/miniapp-sdk';

  window.addEventListener('load', async () => {
    try {
      // Call this when the UI is ready for the user
      await sdk.actions.ready();
    } catch (e) {
      console.error('MiniApp sdk.actions.ready() failed', e);
    }
  });
</script>


If there is already a script that imports @farcaster/miniapp-sdk or calls sdk.actions.ready(), do NOT create a duplicate.
Instead, ensure there is a single sdk.actions.ready() call that runs after the UI has loaded.

Do not modify any other existing scripts or logic.

4. Do not break anything else

Do not rename any files.

Do not move any existing files.

Do not change other meta tags, scripts, or markup besides what I asked.

After changes, ensure all files still parse correctly (valid HTML, valid JSON).

When you are done, summarize exactly what files you created or changed and show the final contents of:

.well-known/farcaster.json

The <head> section of the main HTML file

The new <script type="module"> block you added before </body>
